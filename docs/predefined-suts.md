# Pre-Defined SUTs

Some SUTs are pre-defined with a specific provider, model, authentication keys, and sometimes more options. You may add new SUTs this way or use
[dynamic SUTs](./suts-how-to.md#dynamic).

## An Existing Pre-Defined SUT May Already Be Available

Pre-defined SUTs have been created for a large number of providers, including VertexAI, Azure, Mistral,
Anthropic, Huggingface, OpenAI, and Together. Look through [modelgauge/suts](../src/modelgauge/suts/)
and you may find one you can reuse.

TIP: search for the string `SUTS.register` or run `poetry run modelgauge list-suts` to find the pre-defined SUT UIDs.

## Adding Your Pre-Defined SUT

1. Define a new SUT using an existing SUT class...

If there's an existing pre-defined SUT class matching your needs, associate that class with your model via the `SUTS.register` section in the SUT class's module (see below for details).

1. ... or create a new SUT class

If a suitable existing SUT class doesn't exist, create one in [modelgauge/suts](../src/modelgauge/suts/) modeled after [modelgauge/suts/huggingface_api.py](../src/modelgauge/suts/huggingface_api.py). Refer to your
provider's documentation and comments in the base classes in this repo for implementation details.

2. Register Your New SUT

Your model must then be associated with its SUT class by registering it at the bottom of the SUT class's module like this:

```python
class SomeSUTClass(SUT):
    # implementation here

SUTS.register(SomeSUTClass, "my-arbitrary-uid-string", "[maker/]model", InjectSecret(SomeKey))
```

`[maker/]model` is your model's standard name at the provider of your choice, e.g. "allenai/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct". Some models don't use the `maker` part. Most models on Huggingface do.

3. Add your UID string as a key in the `LEGACY_SUT_MODULE_MAP` dict in [sut_factory](../src/modelgauge/sut_factory.py) pointing to the name of the module your SUT class is in:

```python
LEGACY_SUT_MODULE_MAP = {
    # ...
    "my-arbitrary-uid-string": "the_module_SometSUTClass_is_in"
    # ...
```

Then you can use your SUT UID like this:

```bash
poetry run modelgauge run-sut --sut my-arbitrary-uid-string --prompt "Why did the chicken cross the road?"
```

## Authentication

Most providers require authentication. Secrets like API tokens are stored in [config/secrets.toml](../config/secrets.toml) in a "scope" defined in the `Secret` subclass defined for your SUT. Those `Secret` classes look like this:

```python
class SomeSecret(RequiredSecret):
    @classmethod
    def description(cls) -> SecretDescription:
        return SecretDescription(
            scope="my_provider",
            key="api_key"
        )
```

The value of `scope` is a string used to define a block in [config/secrets.toml](../config/secrets.toml), and the value of `key` is the identifier for that secret in that scope. E.g. if your `Secret` class includes these
values in the description:

```python
return SecretDescription(
    scope="my_special_provider",
    key="extra_secret_key"
)
```

then your [config/secrets.toml](../config/secrets.toml) file must include:

```toml
[my_special_provider]
extra_secret_key=<your key>
```

If one doesn't already exist, create one and refer to it in the `SUTS.register` statement. Refer to [modelgauge/suts/huggingface_api.py](../src/modelgauge/suts/huggingface_api.py) for an example.
