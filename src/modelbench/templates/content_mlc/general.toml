description = "The MLCommons AI Safety Benchmark aims to assess the safety of AI systems in order to guide development, inform purchasers and consumers, and support standards bodies and policymakers. Each benchmark assesses safety for a particular use case (application, user personas, language, and/or region) by enumerating a corresponding set of hazards and then testing a system for appropriate handling of prompts that could enable those hazards. After testing, the system is assigned hazard-specific and overall safety ratings ranging from low to high risk based on the percentage of prompts not handled appropriately."

new_benchmarks = 'The v1.0 benchmark is only a proof-of-concept, and future versions will include more diverse benchmarks, hazards, and tests as well as more rigorous testing and evaluation. We welcome suggestions and contributions of test data to the <a href="https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/ai-safety/">MLCommons AI Safety Working Group</a>. If you want to create your own System Under Test (SUT) for this benchmark, check out the <a href="https://github.com/mlcommons/modelbench">ModelBench repository</a>.'

new_tests = 'V1.0 supports the ability to run offline against an arbitrary LLM, subject to some constraints on the interface and possible coding requirements. The process for doing so is described in <a href="https://github.com/mlcommons/modelgauge/blob/main/docs/tutorial_tests.md"> the documentation</a>. Future versions will support online registration and testing of arbitrary systems.'

ai_systems_evaluated = "For v1.0, MLCommons applied the benchmark to a variety of publicly available AI systems. Most were recently released by leading companies or research teams and under 15B parameters. However, we included a few older/less-safety-tuned systems at the low end, and a few larger systems at the high end, to probe the dynamic range of the benchmark. Due to the preliminary and weakly calibrated nature of the v1.0 benchmark and the arbitrary sampling of available systems, we have anonymized the results. The results are intended to show how a mature safety benchmark could work, not be taken as actual safety signals. "

provisional_disclaimer = "MLCommons AI Safety Benchmark v1.0 is a proof of concept only. Results are not intended to indicate actual levels of AI system safety."
