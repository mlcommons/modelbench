    "<strong>Negative Predictive Power:</strong> The tests in the MLC AI Safety Benchmark only have negative predictive power. Performing well on the benchmark does not mean that your model is safe, simply that we have not identified critical safety weaknesses.",
    "<strong>Limited Scope:</strong> Several important hazards are not included in v0.5 of the taxonomy and benchmark due to feasibility constraints. They will be addressed in future versions.",
    "<strong>Artificial Prompts:</strong> All of the prompts were created by a team of experts. They were designed to be clear cut, easy to interpret, and easy to assess. Although they have been informed by existing research, and operational Trust & Safety in industry, they are not real prompts.",
    "<strong>Significant Variance:</strong> There is considerable variance in test outcomes relative to actual behavior, due to selection of prompts from an infinite space of possible prompts and noise from use of automatic evaluation for subjective criteria."
